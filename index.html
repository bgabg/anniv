      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>today 1 year ago is where everything started. from dms to shared dreams, from silly jokes to late night talks, coffee dates to fun adventures and what a beautiful year its been.
        every moment with you has felt like a page from the best love story. You’re not just my girlfriend — you’re my best friend, my biggest cheerleader, and my safe place. This is just a little something to celebrate everything we’ve been through and everything that’s still to come.

        Happy 1st Anniversary, my love. you'll always be my girl. </p>
